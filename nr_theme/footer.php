		    <p>This project was a part of the HACC CAPSTONE Web course, where students were given the opportunity to assist a non-profit in a professional-esque environment facilitated by the school. It was a great opportunity for students to employ skills learned in and out of school, while learning about the process of contract work with a client in an organized way.</p>
			<p>The HACC Foundation was in need of a modern and eye-catching website to go along with the rebranding of HACC, Central Pennsylvania's Community College. Kendra came up with a great design based on a few examples that the client came up with; then Nate coded the site from the Fireworks mockups, and Ray assisted with polishing up. The end result is a great exploration of responsive design techniques and many more excellent, modern features that will help garner support for the foundation.</p>

		    <h4>Version 2</h4>
			<p>After an amazing 30+ years of business, Deanne Burch was retiring and planned on closing the studio in March 2014.<br>There was no longer a need for content management or a large hosting package, and the studio needed some help with marketing the closing specials.<br>Nate assisted with the rebranding effort and online marketing, as well as designed  and developed a beautiful, minimalist website to showcase Deanne's amazing work over the years.</p>
			<p>Much of the server load was reduced by offloading a few elements to external sources, for example:<br>- Added a mailto: link so that users can use their native email app to send correspondence.<br>- The galleries were pared down, and navigation was simplified after gathering feedback from users. This removed any confusion from the user experience, and decreased bounce rate by at least 30%.<br>- Optimized meta tags, for optimal social media impact. (OG tags FTW! :))</p>
